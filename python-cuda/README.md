# Calling CUDA kernels from Python

This is a full example of how to call CUDA kernels from Python with C Extensions. 

## Notes

- This example is targeting Python 2.x.
- It is based on [Robert](http://rmcgibbo.org/ "Robert T. McGibbon")'s [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10034325/can-python-distutils-compile-cuda-code) on StackOverflow.
- This example also used another compiler (PGI compiler) to show how to compile with another compiler.
